                    <p>I grew up near the shore of a bay much like that pictured above. That probably explains
                    my immediate connection to the video it was captured from. Or maybe after almost 30 years
                    of involvement in systems administration I'm just a sucker for the sense of serenity it conveys.</p>

                    <p>Most of my career as a tech professional has been as a sysadmin ("I am root"). For the
                    15 years starting at the beginning of this century I served as lead engineer for directory
                    services ("I am Directory Manager") at a large global company. Over the years I've wrestled with
                    refrigerator-sized servers, tried to make sense of the "camel put together by a committee" that
                    is a certain enterprise resource planning application stack, written a pile of perl code, and
                    fought off potentially crippling DDOS attacks coming from purportedly "secure" networks. I've
                    also happily guided my fair share of polytechnic school graduates through the rough and tumble
                    world of systems integration, "American style" (much to their amusement, and horror!).</p>
                    
                    <p>As more and more software solutions have moved off-premesis to the cloud, I've been spending a
                    lot of time working with the new technologies that are being made possible by application
                    containers, software defined networking and serverless architectures. It's been a wild ride,
                    and it looks like I just won an E-ticket to another round.</p>

                    <p>While most of what I've written is in the form of confidential, but boring, technical documentation,
                    I have authored a few guides that are publicly available on my <a href="https://github.com/plembo/onemoretech/wiki" target="_blank">
                    Github wiki</a>. Here are some examples.</p>

                    <p>Most of the coding I've done has also been for work, and as a result is company confidentaial
                    and not sharable. But here are some samples of a few things I've done outside. Most of my public
                    code can be found under <a href="https://github.com/plembo/onemoretech" target="_blank">onemoretech</a> on my
