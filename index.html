                <h3 id="About">About</h3>
                <p>I grew up near the shore of a bay much like that pictured above. That probably explains
                my immediate connection to the video it was captured from. Or maybe after almost 30 years
                of involvement in systems administration I'm just a sucker for the sense of serenity it conveys.</p>
                <p>
                Most of my career as a tech professional has been as a sysadmin ("I am root"). For the
                15 years starting at the beginning of this century I served as lead engineer for directory
                services ("I am Directory Manager") at a large global company. Over the years I've wrestled with
                refrigerator-sized servers, tried to make sense of the "camel put together by a committee" that
                is a certain enterprise resource planning application stack, written a pile of perl code, and
                fought off potentially crippling DDOS attacks coming from purportedly "secure" networks.  
                </p>
                <p>
                As more and more software solutions have moved off-premesis to the cloud, I've been spending a
                lot of time working with the new technologies that are being made possible by application
                containers, software defined networking and serverless architectures. It's been a wild ride,
                and it looks like I just won an E-ticket to another round.

                <h3 id="Writing">Technical Writing</h3>
               <p>While most of what I've written is in the form of confidential, but boring, technical documentation.
                I have written a few guides that are publicly available on my
                [Github wiki](https://github.com/plembo/onemoretech/wiki). Here are some examples.</p>

                <p>One of the problems with working for a big company is that most of the code you
                write is either too narrowly focused for it to be of any interest to others outside
                the enterprise, or as works for hire not your own intellectual property. Here are
                a few examples of code I've written.</p>
