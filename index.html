                <h3 id="About">About</h3>
                <p>I've been a technology professional for over two decades now, focused mostly on
                systems administration and integration. For 15 years I was the lead engineer
                for directory services at a large global company. As more and more software
                solutions have moved off-premesis to the cloud, I've been spending a lot of time
                working with the new technologies that are being made possible like application
                containers, software defined networking and serverless computing.</p>

               <p>While most of what I've written is in the form of confidential, but boring,
                technical documentation, I have written a few articles that are publicly
                available. Here are some examples:</p>
                
                <ul>

                    <li><a href="https://github.com/plembo/onemoretech/wiki/Renaming-files-in-bulk">Renaming Files in Bulk</a></li>

                <h3 id="Code">Code</h3>
                <p>One of the problems with working for a big company is that most of the code you
                write is either too narrowly focused for it to be of any interest to others outside
                the enterprise, or as works for hire not your own intellectual property. Here are
                a few examples of code I've written:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 id="Links">Links</h3>
                <p>These are some links to stuff I think might be important:</p>
